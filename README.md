# 5G-configs-logs
Stores txt files that interface with OAI 5G to configure and read the state of the network.

By default, the current files consider three slices and make OAI 5G to map all connected UEs to the first slice which receives all the 106 PRBs both in DL and in UL.
Once the OAI 5G network is started, the "state_dl.txt" and "state_ul.txt" files will be generated in the folder.
